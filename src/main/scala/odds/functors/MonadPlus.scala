/**
 * MonadPlus type class.
 *
 * Every instance of the Odds probability monad `Rand` needs to
 * provide a corresponding instance of this type class.
 *
 * ==Monad Laws==
 * Implementations of the methods in [[MonadPlus]] should fulfill the
 * following laws (for some equivalence relation `==`):
 * {{{
 *   fmap id                     ==  id
 *   fmap (g compose f)          ==  fmap(g) compose fmap(g)
 *
 *   unit compose f              ==  fmap(f) compose unit
 *   join compose fmap(fmap(f))  ==  fmap(f) compose join
 *
 *   join compose fmap(unit)     ==  join compose unit   â‰…  id
 *   join compose fmap(join)     ==  join compose join
 * }}}
 *
 * The first two laws are just the functor laws for `M`, the second
 * pair are the naturality laws for `unit` and `join`, and the last
 * pair are the actual coherence conditions for monads.
 *
 * If an instance of this class overrides the derived `bind` method
 * (monadic extension), they should conform to the following laws:
 * {{{
 *   bind(f) compose unit  ==  f
 *   bind(unit)            ==  id
 * }}}
 * which can easily be derived from the above laws and the following
 * additional equivalence characterizing monadic extension.
 * {{{
 *   bind  ==  join compose fmap
 * }}}
 *
 * ===Monoidal laws===
 * Instances `M[A]` of the monad also form a monoid with operation
 * `plus` and identity `zero`.  Hence they should conform to the usual
 * identity and associativity laws for monoids:
 * {{{
 *   mx plus zero          ==  mx
 *   zero plus mx          ==  mx
 *
 *   (mx plus my) plus mz  ==  mx plus (my plus mz)
 * }}}
 *
 * Functions `M[A] => M[B]` between instances are monoid
 * homomorphisms, and should conform to the corresponding laws:
 * {{{
 *   f(zero)        ==  mzero
 *   f(mx plus my)  ==  f(mx) plus f(my)
 * }}}
 * In particular, this implies the following derived laws for
 * functions `A => M[B]` (that is, Kleisli morphisms):
 * {{{
 *   bind(f)(mzero)        ==  mzero
 *   bind(x => mzero)(mx)  ==  mzero
 *   bind(f)(mx plus my)   ==  bind(f)(mx) plus bind(f)(my)
 * }}}
 *
 * ==For functional programmers==
 * This is a type class representing what is commonly referred to as
 * an "additive monad" in functional programming.  That is, a monad
 * with a monoid structure (given by `plus` and `zero`).  Every
 * collection in the Scala collection API is a monad with a monoid
 * structure, and consequently this class provides an implicit
 * conversion decorating its abstract monad functor type `M` with the
 * basic collection operations (see [[MonadPlus.ToScalaMonadic]]).
 *
 * This class corresponds roughly to the `MonadPlus` type class in
 * Haskell.
 *
 * ==For categorists==
 * This class corresponds to a strong monad (or triple) `(M, unit,
 * join)` on the category of Scala types, with a tensorial strength
 * for the Cartesian product.  In addition, the image `M[A]` of an
 * object (type) `A` is a monoid `(M[A], plus, zero)`.  Although this
 * is called an "additive monoid" in the context of functional
 * programming, the functor `M` need not be additive, and hence this
 * is not an additive monad in the categorical sense.
 *
 * @tparam M the Scala type representing the functor of the monad.
